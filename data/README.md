Figure 1.  From R for Data Science.  In tidy data, one file holds one table. In each table, the rows are observations and the columns are variables that store information about the observations.  Each row should contain only 1 observation.  Each column should contain only 1 variable.  Notes about an observation can be made in a column named `notes`
